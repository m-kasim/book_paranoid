ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE

1. Something has changed:
    1. Change happens in all businesses. Be ready for the change. New changes bring new rules
    2. Middle managers discover changes first
    3. The CEO is often the last one to notice a change, because he is inside a protected fortress.
    4. We all need to expose ourselves to the winds of change
    5. Lowest level employees can tell you things you don't know

2. A "10x" change:
- Strategic inflection points
- Forces of competitiveness:
    1. Competitors
    2. Suppliers
    3. Customers
    4. Potential competitors
    5. Product interchangeability
    6. Complementors: software needs hardware; cars need gasoline
- "Things are different. Something has changed"
- "The industry has gone nuts. It's crazy for what people use computers today"
- There are many subtle signals that a strategic inflection point is approaching.
  You should prepare for them while you are healthy
- When the strategic inflection point happens, all you have is your guts and judgement

3. The Morphing of the Computer Industry:
- 1980s: Transformations of business: - horses being replaced by railroads
                                      - small shops being replaced by superstores
- There's a lot of engineering and low-level chemistry involved in semiconductors
- [vertical alignment]: the company makes its own software, own hardware, own branding and sells it via its own sales people
- It's better to specialize in something and sell it to others (trade) than specialize in everything
- Another problem in this approach was that clients wouldn't be able to pick specific (better) individual components from
  other companies. They had to stick with the vertical alignment of the initial company
- This also means, that the clients were "locked in" with the clients they chose for a longer time
- The competition was ferocious to win clients. Whoever won the client, had business for longer time
- The introduction of the "10X" microchips came, thus making it more cost-effective to build more powerful chips with the same size
- The industry changed from [vertical] to [horizontal] => more compatibility problems
- Prices become lower, but getting things to work - harder => Rise of software companies
- Competition for mass production has started
- 1981: Intel choses IBM to provide them with chips
- Intel became popular, because IBM was the largest player on the market. And that's why Intel produced the largest amount of CPUs.
  This is why even competitors based their architecture on Intel. You'd rather base your architecture on the largest CPU core.
- IBM has lost prominence because the shift changed from business mainframe computers to small PCs.
  Also, the IBMs manager were used to always winning in the past decades
- Change: When the industry goes through change, the old art practitioners are in trouble.
- Dell: Started a company which allows you to assemble a custom computer
- Dell's business model: Accept mail orders for custom computer configurations, assemble them and deliver them directly
- Unisys: Rather than continuing their old business model, they switched to software, in order to adapt
- Novell: Were developing  hardware but switched to software as well. They captured the opportunity for networking software
- When a strategic inflection point approaches, the old companies are reluctant to accept it, while the new ones embrace it

    3.1. The New Rules of the Horizontal industry:
      1. Do not differentiate without making sure that the change is beneficial for the customer
      2. Opportunity comes when something breaks. Only the first mover has true possibility to grab the chance of market share
         - People who fight the wave of new change, eventually fail
      3. Calculate the market price which the users are willing to pay, then the volume prices, and then work like devil to optimize the other costs to profit
         - "What the market will bear": We should set prices based on what our customers are willing to pay, not based on our costs.
         - The above works for "mass production". If you calculate prices based on "costs" you will end up in a niche position

- As the business becomes more competitive, companies are forced to specialize with their core business
- Horizontal industries are more cost-effective. It's easier to be best at one thing, than being best at several

4. They are everywhere (The strategic inflection points):
- Reading news has a relation with detecting "10X" changes (e.g. disruptive changes)
- When you have competition, what has worked before is no longer working
- How to compete with Walmart: A specialized store (Toys Я Us) or providing an Experience/environment rather than products
- PC became cheaper than Mac, because there were a lot of manufacturers competing
- Steve Jobs suffered wit NEXT because he did not adapt to the new reality of the PC market
- How business cycles work: Competitors deliver a product, we respond, they respond and so on
- Every once in a while technology changes drastically
- The attitude of denial of a change is deadly
- Even Charlie Chaplin couldn't resist in the end the movies with sounds
- Singapore has emerged as a shipping port, because it adapted the idea of new containers right on time
  New York did not have a physical room for the new equipment, so it started losing money
- Fundamental rule in technology: "Whatever that _can_ be done, _will_ be done"
- You cannot ignore change. You need to adapt to it
- Harvard Business Review analysis: Businesses fail because companies leave their customers, or the customers leave their companies
- Everything is a gradual process. The essence is to recognize the process as it forms. Only the Paranoid survive
- Customer habits do change
- When you enter the market with a new product, everyone is talking about it
- However, after the show is done, the person, who is the star of an era, is often the last to adapt to a change
- In practice, things do not work out that well
- Intel became the solo producer of microprocessor chips, because their competition simply gave up.
  They had a "10X" supplier position = Monopoly because the mass production of chips was expensive
- Patents: Things are always first abused (drugs) before the government finally decides to intervene
- AT&T: It was a monopoly, but then it was broke down. New competitors entered the market. The Government allowed only local monopolies
- In general monopolies do not cater to customers
- Monopolies react very bad when they lose their monopoly (get privatized) and have to compete with the global market
- Too drastic changes can be fatal
- A huge mark for a company to be a winner or loser is its adaptability
- "Adapt or die"

5. Why not do it ourselves?
- Intel was forced to change its initial business during a crisis period
- Intel was found in 1968
- Each startup has a core idea
- Smaller transistors and closer to each other can transmit electronic signals faster
- Intel became so big, because transistors became widely used in electronics: VCRs computers, Tablets, Smartphones
- They initially created transistors for memory
- They started small: A chip which can store "64 bits" / digits
- 1969: The have bid on a project to build a "64 bits" chip. They built it first and they won
- Intel 1103: The world's first DRAM chip
- Intel is focused on real output: "tangible results"
- Intel teams argue a lot: "constructive confrontation"
- Intel had an advantage over competitors, because they designed hardware, and hardware is easier to patent, than software
  Also, there is not that much people capable of doing hardware design
- Intel was initially 100% market share of memory chips, then gradually reduced as competitors entered.
  This resulted in everyone winning a chunk of the cake: "Round 1 goes to Intel, Round 2 goes to Mostek, ..."
- The Japanese started producing the same thing with lower costs, thanks to their larger production facilities and economies of scale
  This had forced Intel to seek for a "Premium" niche. This is when they started R&D on microprocessors
- Intel invested no matter what heavily on R&D and technology.
- The only way to stay competitive is to keep innovating and discover technology, which is not available to others
- After a speedy buildup you cannot slow down fast
- Intel was losing money on memory production, but they still continued with it, because they had money to burn. It ended nowhere
- A big change must be achieved in smaller steps
- !: Most of the clients of Intel had already figured out that they will exit the memory business.
  So they have already made arrangement with other companies. Intel weren't as big as they thought they are
- People who have no emotional stake at taking a decision can see what needs to be done early
- CEOs are often replaced during strategic inflection points, because they are emotionally attached to the order which was before.
  They are often replaced with people from outside
- Applying an impersonal logic to the situation helps seeing things much clearer
- Going through strategic inflection points mean having zero emotional attachment
- "It actually went on better than I've expected" - They knew what was to come. They were relieved.
- Shutting down old factories gave Intel a chance to modernize the infrastructure. They didn't need them anyway
  That didn't make it any less painful, though
- Change always happens from within. First the managers and employees were happy, then the outside world
- Even though now Intel is in the CPU business, they have side products as well
- "The Hidden Hand": Middle managers subconsciously take decisions in favor of CPUs than memories
- People who are in the trenches see the changes first

6. "Signal" or "Noise"?
- Give things names in order to gain power over them
- Not every change is "10X" change. Some changes are just "noise", not signals
- However, still re-estimate the threat and watch if it grows
- It's like watching blips of a radar
- Even thought some people might claim otherwise, not every "10X" change is a "10X" change
- Compatibility is very important
- Different products/projects require different/more internal resources for development/marketing/sales
- If you have two competing products, you might end up in the trouble of which one to highlight when meeting with a customer
- Sometimes, taking a decision of time is - crucial -
- Teams are often divided to warring camps, with each one 100% sure that they are right
- "Andy, this is like the fashion business. We need something new."
- Sometimes the event which signalizes a strategic inflection point is just clear
- But most of the time changes approach on little cat feet

Ask the following questions about whether something is a strategic inflection point:
- Key competitors:
  The "Silver bullet" question: If you had a silver bullet and a gun which one of your opponents would you shoot?
  If you have multiple competitors with little merit as an answer to this question, then it means that the focus of the competition
  has significantly changed
- Key complementor:
  Is the key complementor/s about to change or be replaced? Then this might signal shifting industry dynamics
- People around you:
  Do competent people seem to be "loosing it"?
- Management is like genetic selection. After you are successful for a long time, your genes might retard
- If you are not getting "it" anymore, it may be because "it" has now changed
- Cassandra: A priestess who foretold the fall of Troy
- "Cassandras" are often middle managers
- People in sales know best the customer tastes and the adjusting tendencies, because they spend so much time "outside in the real world"
  where the "real winds are blowing in their faces"
- Bad products lead to bad sales which means that the sales person will get less commission. This is why they know things first
- Sales managers feel scared in "enemy territory"
- When you receive a possible signal of a change, watch how it develops over time, in order to make a good judgement
- Words do not matter, only facts. Do not listen to what people say. Watch the actions
- You don't need to search for the "Cassandras". Often they find you
- It's all sales: Someone who sells a product with passion, will also "sell" their concerns to you
- Don't argue with them: Listen to them and learn what is that affects them and why it affects them in this way
- Quality the time spent listening to them as time spent on learning what is happening in the distant ends of the business
- Snow: When spring comes, snow melts always in the periphery first, because there it is most exposed.
  Then it gradually starts to melt towards the center.
- Geographically distant people often also have distant news
- Then you triangulate all the feedback (distant and near) together
- People like reading books, instead of random excerpt of sentences, because the whole thing makes sense together and feels complete.
  It forms a complete story with a beginning and end. This is why people like stories
- Try to show your point, while also showing the other point constructively as well.
- Allocation: By natural evolution, middle managers moved wasteful materials from products with little margin to ones with greater margin in
  order to prevent losses
- Entrepreneurship: Moving things from areas with lower productivity and yield to areas with higher productivity and yield
- New products are being constantly hyped up. Once you explore them deeper, you'd see that the are not exactly what they claim to be
- "Trap of the first version": Everyone is hyped up, but no one knows it will stay for long.
- 1991: Apple was considering PDAs - Personal Digital Assistants - and everyone thought they could disrupt the industry
- Apple Newton (Apple PDA) was criticized for its shortcomings
- Often times, the first version - of anything - sucks and receives a bad acceptance
- People didn't like the first graphical computer LISA. They thought Windows was just a DOS with a nice face and the PDAs were impractical
  Years later, they were wrong
- You can't judge the significance of something by the first version
- Discussions and debates help bring together different points of view and merge them together
- Yet, sometimes you have rely only on your gut feeling
- Fear of losing is essential
- It is fear which motivates you always to improve
- Companies which have perfected a certain repetitive task are always full with complacency.
  But when change happens, it often hits them hardest
- Managers sometimes fear to bring bad news, out of fear of being punished. This is poisonous for a company
- So, never "shoot the messenger"
- Once the fear of bad news spreads in the organization, people become scared of reporting problems
- Managers never have a chance if "bad news don't reach them"
- Intel has worked very hard to tear down the walls between people who "have knowledge" and "have power"
- One is not better than another. One respects another. One is not intimidated by the power or knowledge of another.
- A culture like this is easy to describe, but hard to create
- It's all about surviving strategic inflection points and parting ways with those who don't
