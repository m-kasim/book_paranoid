ONLY THE PARANOID SURVIVE
Andrew Grove, 1996

1. Something has changed:
    1. Change happens in all businesses. Be ready for the change. New changes bring new rules
    2. Middle managers discover changes first
    3. The CEO is often the last one to notice a change, because he is inside a protected fortress.
    4. We all need to expose ourselves to the winds of change
    5. Lowest level employees can tell you things you don't know

2. A "10x" change:
- Strategic inflection points
- Forces of competitiveness:
    1. Competitors
    2. Suppliers
    3. Customers
    4. Potential competitors
    5. Product interchangeability
    6. Complementors: software needs hardware; cars need gasoline
- "Things are different. Something has changed"
- "The industry has gone nuts. It's crazy for what people use computers today"
- There are many subtle signals that a strategic inflection point is approaching.
  You should prepare for them while you are healthy
- When the strategic inflection point happens, all you have is your guts and judgement

3. The Morphing of the Computer Industry:
- 1980s: Transformations of business: - horses being replaced by railroads
                                      - small shops being replaced by superstores
- There's a lot of engineering and low-level chemistry involved in semiconductors
- [vertical alignment]: the company makes its own software, own hardware, own branding and sells it via its own sales people
- It's better to specialize in something and sell it to others (trade) than specialize in everything
- Another problem in this approach was that clients wouldn't be able to pick specific (better) individual components from
  other companies. They had to stick with the vertical alignment of the initial company
- This also means, that the clients were "locked in" with the clients they chose for a longer time
- The competition was ferocious to win clients. Whoever won the client, had business for longer time
- The introduction of the "10X" microchips came, thus making it more cost-effective to build more powerful chips with the same size
- The industry changed from [vertical] to [horizontal] => more compatibility problems
- Prices become lower, but getting things to work - harder => Rise of software companies
- Competition for mass production has started
- 1981: Intel choses IBM to provide them with chips
- Intel became popular, because IBM was the largest player on the market. And that's why Intel produced the largest amount of CPUs.
  This is why even competitors based their architecture on Intel. You'd rather base your architecture on the largest CPU core.
- IBM has lost prominence because the shift changed from business mainframe computers to small PCs.
  Also, the IBMs manager were used to always winning in the past decades
- Change: When the industry goes through change, the old art practitioners are in trouble.
- Dell: Started a company which allows you to assemble a custom computer
- Dell's business model: Accept mail orders for custom computer configurations, assemble them and deliver them directly
- Unisys: Rather than continuing their old business model, they switched to software, in order to adapt
- Novell: Were developing  hardware but switched to software as well. They captured the opportunity for networking software
- When a strategic inflection point approaches, the old companies are reluctant to accept it, while the new ones embrace it

    3.1. The New Rules of the Horizontal industry:
      1. Do not differentiate without making sure that the change is beneficial for the customer
      2. Opportunity comes when something breaks. Only the first mover has true possibility to grab the chance of market share
         - People who fight the wave of new change, eventually fail
      3. Calculate the market price which the users are willing to pay, then the volume prices, and then work like devil to optimize the other costs to profit
         - "What the market will bear": We should set prices based on what our customers are willing to pay, not based on our costs.
         - The above works for "mass production". If you calculate prices based on "costs" you will end up in a niche position

- As the business becomes more competitive, companies are forced to specialize with their core business
- Horizontal industries are more cost-effective. It's easier to be best at one thing, than being best at several

4. They are everywhere (The strategic inflection points):
- Reading news has a relation with detecting "10X" changes (e.g. disruptive changes)
- When you have competition, what has worked before is no longer working
- How to compete with Walmart: A specialized store (Toys Ð¯ Us) or providing an Experience/environment rather than products
- PC became cheaper than Mac, because there were a lot of manufacturers competing
- Steve Jobs suffered wit NEXT because he did not adapt to the new reality of the PC market
- How business cycles work: Competitors deliver a product, we respond, they respond and so on
- Every once in a while technology changes drastically
- The attitude of denial of a change is deadly
- Even Charlie Chaplin couldn't resist in the end the movies with sounds
- Singapore has emerged as a shipping port, because it adapted the idea of new containers right on time
  New York did not have a physical room for the new equipment, so it started losing money
- Fundamental rule in technology: "Whatever that _can_ be done, _will_ be done"
- You cannot ignore change. You need to adapt to it
- Harvard Business Review analysis: Businesses fail because companies leave their customers, or the customers leave their companies
- Everything is a gradual process. The essence is to recognize the process as it forms. Only the Paranoid survive
- Customer habits do change
- When you enter the market with a new product, everyone is talking about it
- However, after the show is done, the person, who is the star of an era, is often the last to adapt to a change
- In practice, things do not work out that well
- Intel became the solo producer of microprocessor chips, because their competition simply gave up.
  They had a "10X" supplier position = Monopoly because the mass production of chips was expensive
- Patents: Things are always first abused (drugs) before the government finally decides to intervene
- AT&T: It was a monopoly, but then it was broke down. New competitors entered the market. The Government allowed only local monopolies
- In general monopolies do not cater to customers
- Monopolies react very bad when they lose their monopoly (get privatized) and have to compete with the global market
- Too drastic changes can be fatal
- A huge mark for a company to be a winner or loser is its adaptability
- "Adapt or die"

5. Why not do it ourselves?
- Intel was forced to change its initial business during a crisis period
- Intel was found in 1968
- Each startup has a core idea
- Smaller transistors and closer to each other can transmit electronic signals faster
- Intel became so big, because transistors became widely used in electronics: VCRs computers, Tablets, Smartphones
- They initially created transistors for memory
- They started small: A chip which can store "64 bits" / digits
- 1969: The have bid on a project to build a "64 bits" chip. They built it first and they won
- Intel 1103: The world's first DRAM chip
- Intel is focused on real output: "tangible results"
- Intel teams argue a lot: "constructive confrontation"
- Intel had an advantage over competitors, because they designed hardware, and hardware is easier to patent, than software
  Also, there is not that much people capable of doing hardware design
- Intel was initially 100% market share of memory chips, then gradually reduced as competitors entered.
  This resulted in everyone winning a chunk of the cake: "Round 1 goes to Intel, Round 2 goes to Mostek, ..."
- The Japanese started producing the same thing with lower costs, thanks to their larger production facilities and economies of scale
  This had forced Intel to seek for a "Premium" niche. This is when they started R&D on microprocessors
- Intel invested no matter what heavily on R&D and technology.
- The only way to stay competitive is to keep innovating and discover technology, which is not available to others
- After a speedy buildup you cannot slow down fast
- Intel was losing money on memory production, but they still continued with it, because they had money to burn. It ended nowhere
- A big change must be achieved in smaller steps
- !: Most of the clients of Intel had already figured out that they will exit the memory business.
  So they have already made arrangement with other companies. Intel weren't as big as they thought they are
- People who have no emotional stake at taking a decision can see what needs to be done early
- CEOs are often replaced during strategic inflection points, because they are emotionally attached to the order which was before.
  They are often replaced with people from outside
- Applying an impersonal logic to the situation helps seeing things much clearer
- Going through strategic inflection points mean having zero emotional attachment
- "It actually went on better than I've expected" - They knew what was to come. They were relieved.
- Shutting down old factories gave Intel a chance to modernize the infrastructure. They didn't need them anyway
  That didn't make it any less painful, though
- Change always happens from within. First the managers and employees were happy, then the outside world
- Even though now Intel is in the CPU business, they have side products as well
- "The Hidden Hand": Middle managers subconsciously take decisions in favor of CPUs than memories
- People who are in the trenches see the changes first

6. "Signal" or "Noise"?
- Give things names in order to gain power over them
- Not every change is "10X" change. Some changes are just "noise", not signals
- However, still re-estimate the threat and watch if it grows
- It's like watching blips of a radar
- Even thought some people might claim otherwise, not every "10X" change is a "10X" change
- Compatibility is very important
- Different products/projects require different/more internal resources for development/marketing/sales
- If you have two competing products, you might end up in the trouble of which one to highlight when meeting with a customer
- Sometimes, taking a decision of time is - crucial -
- Teams are often divided to warring camps, with each one 100% sure that they are right
- "Andy, this is like the fashion business. We need something new."
- Sometimes the event which signalizes a strategic inflection point is just clear
- But most of the time changes approach on little cat feet

Ask the following questions about whether something is a strategic inflection point:
- Key competitors:
  The "Silver bullet" question: If you had a silver bullet and a gun which one of your opponents would you shoot?
  If you have multiple competitors with little merit as an answer to this question, then it means that the focus of the competition
  has significantly changed
- Key complementor:
  Is the key complementor/s about to change or be replaced? Then this might signal shifting industry dynamics
- People around you:
  Do competent people seem to be "loosing it"?
- Management is like genetic selection. After you are successful for a long time, your genes might retard
- If you are not getting "it" anymore, it may be because "it" has now changed
- Cassandra: A priestess who foretold the fall of Troy
- "Cassandras" are often middle managers
- People in sales know best the customer tastes and the adjusting tendencies, because they spend so much time "outside in the real world"
  where the "real winds are blowing in their faces"
- Bad products lead to bad sales which means that the sales person will get less commission. This is why they know things first
- Sales managers feel scared in "enemy territory"
- When you receive a possible signal of a change, watch how it develops over time, in order to make a good judgement
- Words do not matter, only facts. Do not listen to what people say. Watch the actions
- You don't need to search for the "Cassandras". Often they find you
- It's all sales: Someone who sells a product with passion, will also "sell" their concerns to you
- Don't argue with them: Listen to them and learn what is that affects them and why it affects them in this way
- Quality the time spent listening to them as time spent on learning what is happening in the distant ends of the business
- Snow: When spring comes, snow melts always in the periphery first, because there it is most exposed.
  Then it gradually starts to melt towards the center.
- Geographically distant people often also have distant news
- Then you triangulate all the feedback (distant and near) together
- People like reading books, instead of random excerpt of sentences, because the whole thing makes sense together and feels complete.
  It forms a complete story with a beginning and end. This is why people like stories
- Try to show your point, while also showing the other point constructively as well.
- Allocation: By natural evolution, middle managers moved wasteful materials from products with little margin to ones with greater margin in
  order to prevent losses
- Entrepreneurship: Moving things from areas with lower productivity and yield to areas with higher productivity and yield
- New products are being constantly hyped up. Once you explore them deeper, you'd see that the are not exactly what they claim to be
- "Trap of the first version": Everyone is hyped up, but no one knows it will stay for long.
- 1991: Apple was considering PDAs - Personal Digital Assistants - and everyone thought they could disrupt the industry
- Apple Newton (Apple PDA) was criticized for its shortcomings
- Often times, the first version - of anything - sucks and receives a bad acceptance
- People didn't like the first graphical computer LISA. They thought Windows was just a DOS with a nice face and the PDAs were impractical
  Years later, they were wrong
- You can't judge the significance of something by the first version
- Discussions and debates help bring together different points of view and merge them together
- Yet, sometimes you have rely only on your gut feeling
- Fear of losing is essential
- It is fear which motivates you always to improve
- Companies which have perfected a certain repetitive task are always full with complacency.
  But when change happens, it often hits them hardest
- Managers sometimes fear to bring bad news, out of fear of being punished. This is poisonous for a company
- So, never "shoot the messenger"
- Once the fear of bad news spreads in the organization, people become scared of reporting problems
- Managers never have a chance if "bad news don't reach them"
- Intel has worked very hard to tear down the walls between people who "have knowledge" and "have power"
- One is not better than another. One respects another. One is not intimidated by the power or knowledge of another.
- A culture like this is easy to describe, but hard to create
- It's all about surviving strategic inflection points and parting ways with those who don't

7. Let chaos reign: "Resolution comes through experimentation. Only stepping out of the old ruts"
- Ð¢he "touchy-feely" issues: How people react emotionally during crisis
- During crisis, people tend to think first emotionally, and then rationally
- Going through crisis is the same as going through loss
- It's like stages of grief (denial, avoidance, acceptance)
- Plunging: During crisis sometimes managers tend to plunge in totally unrelated merges and acquisitions in order to keep themselves busy
  This is a defense mechanism in order to avoid dealing with the bigger and more serious problem
- Does your time - your most precious resource - reflect the strategic inflection point?
- Andrew Grove decided to write a book in order to "duck" the "memory problem"
- Sometimes you can create yourself a sink of attention, in order to avoid focusing on the big problem.
  Andrew Grove focused on "big important" mergers instead of focusing on "little mundane tasks as why we are losing money on the small accounts"
- Stick to the basics. Keep it simple.
- Leaders go through denial, acceptance and then to action.
- Sometimes leaders and managers too emotionally invested in their projects. They are often replaced by leaders who are not emotionally invested
- Sometimes you just need someone who is not invested in the past
- The inertia of success: When the environment changes, we instinctively resort to our past and our past strengths. We refuse to acknowledge the change around us
  Like a child which doesn't like which it sees and closes its eyes and counts to 100, because it's likely by then the trouble will go away (Again, a defense mechanism)
- This is the phase of "Just give us a little bit of time"
- Intel's production schedulers (on the lowest level) switched from memories to processors before they were more profitable
- Success inertia: Being stuck at what you do and not try new things
- Strategic dissonance: The management make strategies for one thing, but employees notice that something else is profitable.
  One is said, but another is done.
- Open confrontation: The company culture must allow open confrontations. This is how it works in Intel
- Sometimes when you prepare a well-thought answer and it's diverging from reality, follow up questions with criticism follow
  This may be the first sign of "strategic dissonance" and that "something is not quite right here"
- A clear sign that a strategic inflection point is in progress is: "But how we can say X, when we actually do Y?"
- Let people experiment and try new things => Innovation
- The operating phrase becomes: "Let chaos reign!"
- The old order won't give way to the new one without a phase of chaos and experimentation
- Keep experimenting. That way you diversify. But don't get too diversified!
- Intel has been researching microprocessors for almost 10 years. When the inflection point came - they simply swapped to it
- Timing is everything. If you think about it
  Act when the cash is there, the momentum is there and the business order is in tact
- Accept the fact that strategic inflection points are going to happen and prepare for them
- Andrew Grove has never made changes which he wished he had done earlier: They have been losing money on memories for years but they have
  reacted only when the other branches of Intel started losing money as well
- People and companies proceed to action (and make money) when they are forced to
- Tendencies are easy to be seen in others, but we are blind to see our own tendencies
- Managers have a tendency to do too little too late
- "Industry map": the unsaid things - who matters and who don't. you don't think about it, you just know it.
- When a strategic inflection point happens, people usually don't change their "industry mind maps" instantly
- Constantly update the strategic map of the industry
- You must force yourself to commit your thoughts to paper
- Diagrams help you understand the relationships between things
- As a manager, you need to experiment with filling in the gaps in the new industry structure
- As you discuss new things with people, you make it easier for them to accept the changes
- Sharing a common industry map in the organization helps everyone to adapt better.
- This map with guide you to a better direction with greater clarity and higher confidence in your decisions

8. Rein In Chaos:
"Clarify of a direction, which includes describing what we are going after as well as describing what we will _not_
be going after, is exceedingly important at the late stage of a strategic transformation"
- It's like a group of riders traveling through a hostile territory, not knowing where they are going, knowing only
  that they cannot turn back and that they trust they are going to a better place
- Going through a strategic inflection point = marching through an unknown territory
- While you lead through a territory of unknowns, often others lose confidence and you, and then you lose confidence in yourself
- You cannot skip going through the Valley of Death
- What is going your company going to do for a living? You need to be able to answer that with a single sentence
- "Intel, the microprocessor company" - 1985-1986
- There is the danger of oversimplifying the company and casting a too narrow vision
- People lose confidence in leaders when they are going in circles

Redeploying resources:
- Surviving a strategic inflection point involves changes
- Either people's skills need to be changed or the people will be changed
- Half of the people managed to transform. The other half left
- Don't compromise and don't kid yourself
- Shift production from lower value to higher value
- Andy Groove realized that he needs to learn more about software - Intel dependent on the development of the software industry!
- During this time, Andy Groove had to swallow his pride
- Andy Groove has taken many notes during his software company meetings. The ones he didn't understood - he asked others about it
- Basically, he went back to school. But this was part of the culture of Intel and it was respected
- Admitting that you need to learn something is always difficult
- Do not let your senior position to prevent you from learning new things
- Andy Groove had to take this "extra time to learn" from other things. He "planned redeployment" of his personal time
- You try the best you can. People accept the changes.
- What you dedicate your time to speaks about who you are
- Strategic change starts from your calendar

Leading via strategic actions:
- [strategic actions]: Corporate strategy is formed by small actions which you order others to do
- [plans] sound like speeches and people tend to ignore them; [actions] have immediate impact, because people feel the effect instantly
- It's more realistic to change a company with small incremental steps than with a grand masterplan
- When the time is right for a change? When others still believe in you and you still have the resources and the unstoppable decline has not kicked in
- If something makes more money -> switch more resources to it
- People always tend to wait too much
- The consequences of being early are less onerous than those of being late
- If you act early, even if you are wrong, you will be still less wrong than acting too late!
- But people are more likely to do things late, than to do them early!
- Don't be late: The risk is, if you are late, you can lose it all
- In times of crisis managers often know the direction but are to afraid to jump into it
- [taillight strategy]: in the fog drive after a car of which the lights can be seen, so you are safe to drive fast
  the problem with this strategy is that after you pass the leading car, you have no idea where you are going
- [early movers]: the problem with them is that they have hard time to recognize a [signal] from [noise].
  - they can overreact to a [noise], thinking it is a [signal].
  - however, the early movers often define how the game is played
- [personal computers] became mainstream, because they started having better design, sound and visuals,
  thus they were no longer used only for business
- Put all your eggs in the basket, and WATCH THAT BASKET! -> One goal
- It's hard to exit the Valley of Death if you don't have a single clear goal
- Only The Paranoid Survive: The competition is chasing you, always.
- You will get out of the Valley of Death by outrunning the people who chase you
- People will offer you easier and secure alternatives. No. You cannot hedge. It's too expensive. Instead, you have to focus on a single exit
- You have to commit yourself to certain pace and certain course while passing the Valley of Death
- If you are wrong, you will die.
- But most companies don't die because they are wrong. They die because they don't have a commitment
- Ð¢hey fritter away their resources and energy
- The most dangerous thing is sometimes sitting still

The Clarity Imperative:
- In times of crisis, strong leaders are needed. They are needed to set a direction. It doesn't even need to be the _right_ direction
  People just need a _direction_ in these times
- A Japanese CEO responded to a reporter: "Why would I tell you the company strategy? So you can go and help the competitors?!"
- The truth is, perhaps they didn't have one...
- Confusion is created via conflicting signals
- In times of crisis, employees scrutinize and overreact to statements by CEOs
- [Clarify of direction]:
   - What we are going after and what we are NOT going after.
   - What the Valley looks like on the other side
   - First you let chaos reign, then you rein in chaos
   - But the time for experimentation ends
- People tend to listen more what the market says, than what the company says
- [Role model]: Get involved, shape the details. This has a lot of symbolic value
- How to accept meetings: "Will going into this meeting increase my knowledge about this subject and is this important?"
- How to explain your ideas to other people: Get them together, organize meetings, tell them your vision
- Repetition sharpens the vision
- Take special time to share your vision with the middle management, so they can amplify it
- It's better to let employees find the holes in your strategy, than let the market do it later
- Andrew Grove tries to replies his emails within the day
- Avoid "one-way" communication channels such as video ads and tapes. Use "two-way" communications like email and Skype
- New company strategy must be communicated interactively, by hearing what the employees have to say

Adjusting To The New:
- In order to change the company, you need to change the people
- Changing the people does not necessarily mean to replace them
- People who can't or won't adapt must be replaced
- Good strategic transformation: high level management and low level workers have the same vision
- Transformation: Top management should let employees experiment and let chaos reign and then after multiple new directions
  are shown to rein in chaos
- Intellectual debates inside the company are important for adaptability
- Organizations must be able to debate and then form clearly accepted visions accepted by everyone

The other side of the Silicon Valley:
- Few navigated through the nebulous times and succeeded
- Few will survive, and those who did would never be the same
- When a 10X change is upon us, you could either accept the changes and adapt, or accept a slow decline - which is not a choice at all!

9. The Internet: Signal or Noise? Threat or Promise?
"Anything that can affect industries whose total revenue base is many hundreds of billions of dollars is a big deal"

- When the IPO of Netscape happened, its stock price soared, because it was based on the Internet
- The Netscape browser was once dominant but lost to Internet Explorer and other competitors after the so-called first browser war, its market share falling from more than 90 percent in the mid-1990s to less than 1 percent in 2006

What is the Internet anyway?
- "Good co-op": People acting in their self-interest acting in the global interest as well
- Andrew Grove was debating whether the Internet was a 10X change

Bits and Stolen Eyeballs:
- Internet was a disruption of communications => It impacted telcos
- The Internet had pluses and minuses for the telecommunications companies. Should they hide from it or embrace it?
- In times of crisis, always see the pluses and the minuses of the new changes. And how you can incorporate them and re-invent yourself
- Everything that flows in the Internet is a bunch of bits. And software is a bunch of bits!
- Prior to the Internet, software was distributed via CDs in boxes
- The Internet also provided a new environment for building software
- The Internet was a 10X change for mass media and advertising companies
- Some companies lose a part of the market, and the new companies get that share of the market!
- However, in order to "steal the eyeballs" (migrate the existing users from the old platform to the new one) a lot of introduction,
  seminars and promotion needs to be done
- The losses for those who would not adjust are tremendous, as possibly a new market is being born!

What about us?
- Intel's golden moment: Since due to the better communication provided via the Internet, that would make it easier for developers
  to exchange code faster and create more complex applications which require more bits. That meant more work for Intel!
- Threat for Intel: Light PCs which would just display the result from the computations of powerful centralized computers
- Theory: People purchased their PERSONAL COMPUTERS in order NOT TO DEPEND on club or public computers and to store their private data
- Andrew Grove feared that cheap CPUs might be used by the Internet machines
- Lastly, Andrew Grove makes a step-by-step "Is it 10X Change" test on the Internet
- "But then again, as the CEO, I might be very well the last one to notice..."
- The "formula" let Andrew Grove think that the Internet is not a strategic inflection point. However, his gut feeling was that it _is_
- Sometimes you realize that a lot of the knowledge "familiarity" with a technical subject is in fact - superficial
- Even Andrew Grove has admitted that his own knowledge was "superficial" according his standards
- Intel had to work now with new companies (telcos) in order to prepare for the strategic inflection point of the Internet
- Andrew Grove has decided to make Internet as a separate, distinct strategic goal of Intel

"...Except one last thing. What if the people who believe in the cheap Internet appliance turn out to be right?"
- Andrew Grove didn't believe that the Internet will reverse the clock. However, he realizes his genes has adapted for the previous period, not for what is to come!
- Only The Paranoid Survive: Intel has already started building a small, cheap inexpensive Internet chip
- "Let this group try to derail our strategies themselves!"
- Let the massive change come from the "internal Cassandras"
- "A strong signal, that something has changed..."
